## TruStory Go Monorepo

This is a Go monorepo for all non-TruChain related services for TruStory. It is based on, but not a fork of: https://github.com/flowerinthenight/golang-monorepo. It allows for multiple services to co-exist in a single repo while only building services that are updated. Pull in features from [golang-monorepo](https://github.com/flowerinthenight/golang-monorepo) as needed.
